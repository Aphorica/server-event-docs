# Components
The utility consists of two components, one installed in the
client, and the other in the server.  They are:
 - [server-event-client](server-event-client.html), and
 - [server-event-mgr](server-event-mgr.html)

Each of these is installed via `npm install` or `yarn add` in
their respective environments. 

Specific documentation on each is in the corresponding link.
